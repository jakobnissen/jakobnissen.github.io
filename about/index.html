This blog is about programming, mostly, and sometimes biology.</p> <h2 id=how_i_got_here ><a href="#how_i_got_here" class=header-anchor >How I got here</a></h2> <p>When studying in university to become a molecular biologist, I discovered my love for programming during a course in bioinformatics. I became obsessed, and one year later began a PhD in bioinformatics where I could combine my two loves: Genomics and coding.</p> <p>Even though it was as late as 2016, Python had just replaced Perl as the lingua franca in bioinfo. I quickly developed a strong dislike for Perl and R, and dove headfirst into Python, wanting to learn as much as possible, and wanting to use Python for everything.</p> <p>While Python was great and flexible, I spent the next year butting my head against the performance wall. See, I worked in metagenomics, a sub-field of bioinfo characterised by large datasets. When developing my main PhD project, <a href="https://github.com/RasmussenLab/Vamb">Vamb</a>, it quickly became clear that &quot;Python for everything&quot; just was not feasible. I really tried though - attempting to master Numpy, Numba, PyTorch and Cython, all in order to squeeze acceptable performance out of Python. Eventually, Vamb ended up using a combination of Numpy, PyTorch and Cython &#40;yes, all three&#41;.</p> <p>In my desperate search for <em>good</em> solutions, I stumbled upon Julia. I didn&#39;t like it in the beginning. It was too unlike Python - too <em>weird</em>. But boy, could it run fast. After seeing my own clumsy Julia code easily beat my optimized Cython, I tried to give Julia a shot. Eventually, the weirdness wore off and its underlying design beauty began to shine through to me.</p> <p>Much later, perhaps around early of 2020, I decided I needed to learn a statically compiled language to broaden my skills. Rust would complement Julia well, as the two languages had wildly different design goals. So I gave Rust a go, and had to quit in frustration. Tried again later, and failed again, but somehow it stuck the third time. Unlike Julia, I instantly liked Rust, even when I felt too dumb for it. It was just <em>too well designed</em> to not like.</p> <p>Currently, I use Julia and Python on a daily basis at work, making scientific software.</p> <h2 id=software ><a href="#software" class=header-anchor >Software</a></h2> <p>Besides this blog, I have made a few things, including:</p> <h4 id=python ><a href="#python" class=header-anchor >Python</a></h4> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb">Vamb</a> - variational autoencoders for metagenomic binning</p> </ul> <h4 id=rust ><a href="#rust" class=header-anchor >Rust</a></h4> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/alen">Alen</a> - simple terminal alignment viewer.</p> </ul> <h4 id=julia ><a href="#julia" class=header-anchor >Julia</a></h4> <ul> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/ScanByte.jl">ScanByte.jl</a> - find a byte in a chunk of memory - fast.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/StackCollections.jl">StackCollections.jl</a> - optimized, fixed-bit collections.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/MinHash.jl">MinHash.jl</a> - efficient, generic minhashing.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/LibDeflate.jl">LibDeflate.jl</a> - bindings to the fast de/compression library libdeflate.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/CodecBGZF.jl">CodecBGZF.jl</a> - read and write BGZF files.</p> <li><p><a href="https://github.com/jakobnissen/ErrorTypes.jl">ErrorTypes.jl</a> - Rust-like recoverable error types.</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > Jakob Nybo Nissen.
