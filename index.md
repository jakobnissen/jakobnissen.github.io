@def title = "viralinstruction"

Hi! I'm Jakob, a researcher-programmer working in bioinformatics. I write about scientific programming, mostly about [Julia](https://julialang.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I also sometimes write about cool things in genomics, virology or molecular biology.
