* Make table of contents nicer:
    - Perhaps add a box around it
    - Don't underline links in it?
    - Don't number points

* Check if there is better syntax highlighting for Julai
* Add a "Julia code" style: Colored box, perhaps with a small Julia symbol in the corner?
* Figure out about fonts: Which ones can I use? Change the code font, maybe JuliaMono?
